Repaint of the Headwind A330-900 for Qantas Freight A330-200 P2F VH-EBF.
The livery has been recreated as close as possible given the stretched fuselage length to the real aircraft.
Main upper deck cargo door is painted on only, the real passenger to freight conversion removes the 2, 3 and 4 doors. 
The repaint has minimised their obviousness, however, L2 being the main door is hard coded into the model.
