Repaint of the Zibo 737-800X for the Royal Australian Airforce BBJ fleet.
A36-001 and A36-002 are painted based on photos indicating livery for 2022. The cockpit config is based on public photos and guesswork.

Note: Both of these aircraft are -700 variants in real life, this repaint removes the forward overwing exit and escape path light from the textures of the airframe, however, they are hard modelled into the airframe and still exist if you open / turn them on respectively.



Installation
============

Copy the contents of the liveries folder into the 'X-Plane 11(or 12)\Aircraft\B737-800X\liveries' folder.
